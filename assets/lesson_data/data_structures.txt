Data Structures: Fundamental Concepts

What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are essential building blocks for creating efficient algorithms and software systems.

Common Data Structures:

1. Arrays
- Linear data structure storing elements of the same type
- Fixed size in most programming languages
- Allows random access to elements using index
- Time complexity: O(1) for access, O(n) for search
- Space complexity: O(n)

2. Linked Lists
- Dynamic data structure with nodes containing data and pointers
- Types: Singly linked, Doubly linked, Circular linked
- Time complexity: O(1) for insertion/deletion at head, O(n) for search
- Space complexity: O(n)

3. Stacks
- Last In First Out (LIFO) structure
- Main operations: push, pop, peek/top
- Applications: Function calls, expression evaluation, undo operations
- Time complexity: O(1) for all operations
- Space complexity: O(n)

4. Queues
- First In First Out (FIFO) structure
- Main operations: enqueue, dequeue, front
- Applications: Process scheduling, breadth-first search
- Time complexity: O(1) for all operations
- Space complexity: O(n)

5. Trees
- Hierarchical structure with nodes and branches
- Binary trees: each node has at most two children
- Binary Search Trees: left child < parent < right child
- Applications: File systems, decision trees, databases
- Time complexity varies by type and operation

6. Hash Tables
- Key-value pairs for fast lookup
- Uses hash function to map keys to array indices
- Handles collisions through chaining or open addressing
- Average time complexity: O(1) for insertion, deletion, search
- Worst case: O(n)

Time Complexity Analysis:
- O(1): Constant time - best case
- O(log n): Logarithmic time - very efficient
- O(n): Linear time - acceptable for small datasets
- O(n log n): Linearithmic time - common for efficient sorting
- O(nÂ²): Quadratic time - inefficient for large datasets

Choosing the Right Data Structure:
Consider factors like:
- Access patterns (sequential vs random)
- Frequency of insertions and deletions
- Memory constraints
- Need for sorting
- Search requirements

Understanding data structures is crucial for:
- Writing efficient algorithms
- Optimizing program performance
- System design interviews
- Building scalable applications
